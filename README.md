# ContactWave

**ContactWave** is a web-based platform that allows users to easily share their contact information with others using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. With this platform, users can create an account, input their contact information, and write an URL that includes their unique ID to an NFC card. Others can then tap the NFC card with their smartphone to automatically display the user's contact information.
